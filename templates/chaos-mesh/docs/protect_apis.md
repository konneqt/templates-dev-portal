# Generating Tokens for APIs

This guide explains how to secure API executions using OAuth2 tokens generated through QIAM. By leveraging QIAMâ€™s token management and validation, you can implement robust authentication and authorization for your APIs.

Keep in mind, that as a consumer, you already have the access for a consumer key and consumer secret

---

## Prerequisites

1. **QAP Credentials**:
   - Every consumer will have a pre-generated key and secret
2. **Configured Realm and Client**:
   - A realm in QIAM with a client configured.
   - Obtain the client ID and client secret (if required).
3. **QIAM User Accounts**:
   - Users should be created and assigned roles for authorization.
4. **Secured API**:
   - An API or service that will validate the tokens.

## Steps to Secure API with QIAM

### 1. Configure QIAM Client for API Access

1. **Create or Select a Client**:
   - Navigate to your QIAM admin console.
   - Select or create a client to represent your API.
2. **Enable Authorization**:
   - Set `Access Type` to `confidential` for server-to-server interactions or `public` for browser-based clients.
3. **Set Redirect URI**:
   - Configure the redirect URI, if applicable, based on the client type.

### 2. Obtain an Access Token

APIs require an access token for execution. Access tokens can be obtained by authenticating through QIAM using one of the supported OAuth2 grant types.

#### Example Using Resource Owner Password Grant:
```json
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=password" \
  -d "client_id=<your-client-id>" \
  -d "client_secret=<your-client-secret>" \
  -d "username=<user-username>" \
  -d "password=<user-password>" \
  http://<QIAM-server>/realms/<realm-name>/protocol/openid-connect/token
